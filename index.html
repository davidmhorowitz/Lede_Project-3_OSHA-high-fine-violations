<h1>Dollar stores are notorious for neglecting workers’ safety. At Dollar General and Dollar Tree, it’s getting worse.

<p></p>
<h3>Last year, the number of high-fine violations at Dollar General and Dollar Tree skyrocketed. This year, these numbers are projected to grow to around twice those amounts.</h3>
<p><h6>By David Mamaril Horowitz</h6></p>

<p>A cursory Google search for problems at dollar stores shows that worker health and safety violations are widespread and well documented at Dollar Tree and Dollar General. </p>

<p class="indent">The Occupational Safety & Health Administration, the sector of the U.S. Department of Labor tasked with penalizing violators, doled out heavy fines to the two dollar store companies and published numerous press releases about them.
</p> 
<p class="indent">But a new analysis, looking at OSHA’s database of high-fine penalties (worth $40,000 or more), shows that the two companies have each accrued exponentially more penalties than any other private employer in the U.S.

</p>

<p class="indent">Since 2015, Dollar Tree and Dollar General have accrued 147 and 124 high-fine penalties, respectively. The next private employer with the most violations, Target, is also their direct competitor — yet, it has only 19 of these penalties.
</p>

<p class="indent">And, recent trends show that OSHA’s highest fines have been incapable of lessening the number of violations. In fact, despite these fines, the two dollar store companies have each worsened over the last year and a half — with Dollar General getting dramatically worse.

<p class="indent"> A second analysis shows that Dollar General’s fines from these penalties skyrocketed from $7 per employee in 2021 to $52 in 2022 — an increase of 743%.  </p>

<p class="indent"> The analysis, done on July 24, showed that Dollar General had already surpassed that, owing about $65 per employee from high-fine penalties this year. At this rate, it will owe $111 per employee by the end of the year — doubling last year’s amount owed.  </p>

<p class="indent"> While not as dramatic, Dollar Tree also appears unhindered by OSHA’s highest fines. In 2021, the company’s high fines more than tripled, from $7 to $22 per employee. As of July 24, the company surpassed that figure, owing $24 per employee. Projecting through the end of the year, the company will owe $42 per employee — nearly double the amount per employee that it did in 2022.
  </p>
  
<p class="indent"> These numbers are more than 100 times greater than those at Target — the private employer with the third most high-fine penalties and also a direct competitor of the two companies. 
</p>
  
<p class="indent"> The amount Target  owes through these penalties has remained relatively stable — and the company owes 30 cents per employee. And, at this rate, Dollar General will owe 367 times more in high-fine penalties than Target will by the end of the year.
