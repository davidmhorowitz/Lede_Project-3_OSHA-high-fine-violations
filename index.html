<h1>The U.S. government's highest fines haven't stopped dollar stores from violating worker safety regulations
<p></p>
<h3>Last year, the number of high-fine violations at Dollar General skyrocketed. It's July — and the retail giant has already surpassed last year's figure.</h3>

<p>This is all placeholder text ... will need another day to fix this up, clean up the file and do the README. The charts are legit, but all of the following text is irrelevant.target="_new" href="https://sanfrancisco.nextrequest.com/requests">NextRequest</a>, where people submit their inquiries through an online portal.</p>

<p class="indent">There are more than 20,000 requests, 3,800 sent over the last year. A look at every request over the last year pulls up plenty of trivia. There are 5.4 million words. After filtering generic language, “street,” “sexual” and “health” appear to be the most common. But beyond the trivia, using the following table to explore requesters’ word usage by department makes it easier to spot unusual tendencies.</p> 
<p class="indent">Once a word sticks out, simply look it up on <a target="_new" href="https://sanfrancisco.nextrequest.com/requests">NextRequest</a>.</p>

<div class="flourish-embed flourish-chart" data-src="visualisation/14538377"><script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script></div>
</p>
<p class="indent">For example, with 1,306 uses, “sexual” was the second most common word, yet it was almost never mentioned in requests sent to Public Works and Public Health — the two departments that were <em>by far</em> the most popular on NextRequest.
</p>


<p class="indent">This naturally prompts a cursory search on NextRequest for the word “sexual,” which reveals that a person named “Michael Ayele” has repeatedly made long, drawn-out requests that appear to rarely elicit a productive response from San Francisco.
 
</p>
<p class="indent"> A quick usage of our table confirms this by showing that nearly every single use of the word “sexual” came from the Arts and Ethics commissions — and that, similarly, the sixth and seventh most used words are “michael and “ayele” — existing solely in requests sent to the Arts and Ethics commissions.

<h5><strong>Methodology</strong></h5>
</p></p>
</p>
<p class="indent">The data, scraped from NextRequest, encapsulates requests sent through San Francisco’s NextRequest portal from July 2022 to July 2023. Due to time constraints, the project has several notable weaknesses. The greatest is that the dataset would ideally count a word only once per request — no more. Moreover, certain departments publicize the NextRequest website more than others, resulting in certain departments’ words being overrepresented.
